# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project has met the requirements that were asked by the Odin project. In the future, many improvements can be implemented such as a GUI. As a result, this project will be returned to in the future. 

08/06/24 - Added additional interactivity to the project by creating rock, paper scissor buttons and displaying a message with an outcome of each round. Whenever a player has a score of 5, the game will end and the winner is declared.
